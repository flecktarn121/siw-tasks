I 001	what similarity laws must be obeyed when constructing aeroelastic models of heated high speed aircraft  
I 002	what are the structural and aeroelastic problems associated with flight of high speed aircraft  
I 004	what problems of heat conduction in composite slabs have been solved so far  
I 008	can a criterion be developed to show empirically the validity of flow solutions for chemically reacting gas mixtures based on the simplifying assumption of instantaneous local chemical equilibrium  
I 009	what chemical kinetic system is applicable to hypersonic aerodynamic problems
